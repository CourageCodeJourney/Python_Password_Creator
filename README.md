# Python Password Creator

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating passwords, checking their strength, and saving them to a text file. It utilizes the tkinter library for GUI development and incorporates various functions for password generation and strength checking.

## Features

- Generate single passwords of specified length.
- Generate multiple passwords and save them to a text file.
- Check the strength of a single password entered by the user.
- Check the strength of passwords stored in a text file.
- Provides feedback on password strength.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library
- passfunctions module (provided separately)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
3. Place the `passfunctions.py` module in the same directory as the main script or in a directory accessible to the script.

## Usage

1. Run the script (`python password_creator.py`).
2. Use the buttons on the GUI to perform the desired action:
   - Generate Single Password: Generates a single password of specified length.
   - Generate Multiple Passwords to Text File: Generates multiple passwords and saves them to a text file.
   - Check Password Strength: Checks the strength of a single password entered by the user.
   - Check Password Strength from Text File: Checks the strength of passwords stored in a text file.
   - Quit Program: Exits the application.
3. Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the GUI.
